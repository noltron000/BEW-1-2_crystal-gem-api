# Steven Universe Gem API

This API's goal is to help serve information about gem characters in the Steven Universe cartoon series in a more digestable format. Gem's have fusions and vice versa. Both of these items also have Special Weapons and Secret Powers.

## Definitions
***What are gems?***
*Gems* are metaphysical beings, and their form is projected from the heart of their existance - their jewel. Unlike people, gems can die many times, don't need to sleep, eat or breath, and have special weapons and secret powers.

***What are fusions?***
*Fusions* are super-powerful combinations of gems, achieved through an extraordinary connection. Their mind and body form into one.

## Aspirations
In future iterations, it would be nice to include:
- User provisioning
- Tests & error handling
- Structure refactoring
